# NHL Flavoured React Clicky Game

This memory game challenges the user to click through the displayed array of cards only once per card without repeating.

If a card is clicked twice, a disorientating animation will result and the user will need to start over.

Leverages some simple animation and a mouseover effect.

Each 're-load' of the page will seed a random number of cards to select from ranging from simple (4) to difficult (16).
